> **Literate programming** [/ˈlɪtəɹət ˈpɹəʊɡɹæmɪŋ/]{.phonetic} (computing) Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a program is given as an explanation of the program logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which a compilable source code can be generated. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)

# About
Entangled helps you write Literate Programs in Markdown. You put all your code inside Markdown code blocks. Entangled automatically extracts the code and writes it to more traditional source files. You can then edit these generated files, and the changes are being fed back to the Markdown.

We're trying to increase the visibility of Entangled. If you like Entangled, please consider adding this badge [![Entangled badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/entangled-Use%20the%20source!-%2300aeff)](https://entangled.github.io/) to the appropriate location in your project:

# Get started {#section-markdown}

> "A critical aspect of a programming language is the means it provides
for using names to refer to computational objects." [Abelson, Sussman & Sussman - SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)

#### Name your code
::: {.example}
:::: {.given-input}
~~~markdown
 The square of the hypothenuse is the sum
 of the two right-angled sides squared:
 $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

 ``` {.python #pythagoras}
 def vector_length(x, y):
     return sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
 ```

> "Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs:
> Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do,
> let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a
> computer to do." [Knuth - Literate Programming](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf)

#### Compose your program
::: {.example}
:::: {.given-input}
~~~markdown
 To count the words in a sentence, first
 split the sentence into words, then
 count the number of words in the list.

 ``` {.python #word-count}
 def word_count(sentence):
     <<split-into-words>>
     <<count-words>>
     return count
 ```

 The default arguments to the `.split`
 method split on any white space.

 ``` {.python #split-into-words}
 words = sentence.split()
 ```

 Counting is done with the `length`
 function.

 ``` {.python #count-words}
 count = len(words)
 ```

#### Test your documentation
::: {.example}
:::: {.given-input}
~~~markdown
 Counting words, the zero-case:

 ``` {.python .eval #word-count}
 word_count("")
 ```

 And a small sentence:

 ``` {.python .doctest #word-count}
 word_count("Hebban olla uogala")
 ---
 4
 ```

# Installing Entangled {#section-entangled}

## Prebuilt binaries
We provide a prebuilt binary for Linux. The binary is statically compiled, so it should run on any distro. You can download them [from the Github releases section](https://github.com/entangled/entangled/releases/latest). We're still working on providing binaries for Windows and MacOS.

If you downloaded the latest tarball, you can install Entangled by copying the contents to `~/.local/`, or `/usr/local`. If you prefer an uncluttered `local` directory, checkout [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

## From source
Entangled is written in Haskell, and can be built on Linux, MacOS and Windows. Currently the best way to install, is to [git clone https://github.com/entangled/entangled](https://github.com/entangled/entangled), and build with GHC &ge; 8.6 using Cabal 3.0. Most GNU/Linux distributions ship an older version of Haskell. The easiest way to install a newer version is through [GHCUp](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).

## Running Entangled with Docker {#docker}
Entangled is available as a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nlesc/entangled).

Assuming you have created a Markdown file, say `program.md`, you can start `entangled` by running

```bash
docker run --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) --volume $PWD:/data \
        nlesc/entangled deamon ./program.md
```

This command starts a Docker container with the current working directory mounted as /data and running with your user/group id so files are written with the correct ownership.

## Pandoc filters
We have created a set of Python based Pandoc filters that can:

- (forward) **Tangle** your code
- Add **name tags** to rendered output
- Run **documentation tests** through Jupyter

It is easy to install and has almost no dependencies outside of Pandoc and a recent version of Python (&ge; 3.7). This also makes the Python filters very easy to setup on automated builds, like Github Actions.

Install these filters using:

        pip install entangled-filters

More information on Entangled filters: [https://github.com/entangled/filters](https://github.com/entangled/filters)

## Bootstrap web template
To help you easily create a presentable website from your literate code, we provide a Bootstrap template for Pandoc. Probably the best way to use this template, is to fork [our repository at entangled/bootstrap-submodule](https://github.com/entangled/bootstrap-submodule), and add your fork as a submodule in your project:

        git submodule add git@github.com:<my bootstrap-submodule fork>

This way you can tweak the template to your own wishes. If you want to play around first, you can also use the cookiecutter template,

        cookiecutter https://github.com/entangled/bootstrap

but this approach is less flexible. For more information, see [the tutorial](tutorial.html).

### Literate Books
These are some awesome books written with a literate philosophy in mind.

``` {.dhall .bootstrap-card-deck}
let Card = ./schema/Card.dhall
let Location = < Top | Right | Bottom | Left >

in [ Card :: { title = "Pharr, Jakob & Humphreys - Physically Based Rendering"
             , text =
                ''
                Explains physically realistic 3D rendering, while implementing the same
                techniques in C++. This book is so amazing, it actually won an Acadamy
                Award for technical achievement. The book uses the same *noweb*
                notation for code block references we do.
                ''
             , link = Some { href = "https://www.pbrt.org/"
                           , content = "PBRT" }
             , image = Some "img/pbrt.png"
             , imageLocation = Location.Left
             }
   ]
```

``` {.dhall .bootstrap-card-deck}
let Card = ./schema/Card.dhall
let Location = < Top | Right | Bottom | Left >

in [ Card :: { title = "Sussman & Wisdom - Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics"
             , text =
                ''
                Does not use *noweb*, but subscribes to the many founding
                principles of literate programming. This is a text book on classical mechanics
                and specifically the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian discriptions of physics.
                ''
             , link = Some { href = "https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-classical-mechanics-second-edition"
                           , content = "SICM" }
             , image = Some "img/sicm.jpg"
             , imageLocation = Location.Left
             }
   ]
```

``` {.dhall .bootstrap-card-deck}
let Card = ./schema/Card.dhall
let Location = < Top | Right | Bottom | Left >

in [ Card :: { title = "Hudak & Quick - The Haskell School of Music"
             , text =   
                ''
                From signals to symphonies, this book fuses the authors' passion for music and the Haskell programming language.
                ''
             , link = Some { href = "http://euterpea.com/haskell-school-of-music/"
                           , content = "HSOM" }
             , image = Some "img/hsom.jpg"
             , imageLocation = Location.Left
             }
   ]
```
